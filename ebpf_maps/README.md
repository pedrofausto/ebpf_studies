## Requirements
See the main [README.md](../README.md) file.

Also, you may need to generate a "vmlinux.h" (see Andrii Nakryiko's post<sup>[1](https://nakryiko.com/posts/bpf-portability-and-co-re/)</sup>)

A lot of good develeopers provide examples based on libbpf and libbpf-bootstrap. I recommend see the Rafael Tinoco's example<sup>[2](https://github.com/rafaeldtinoco/portablebpf)</sup>)

## Compiling
### with libbpf-bootstrap 
*The following example is based on the code within the ebpf_maps folder*

For the code that use libbpf-bootstrap, just compile passing as argument the code do you want to compile:
`make example`
or
`make minimal`

The `Makefile` will create a ELF binary that have all that is needed. In this case, the userspace (`example.c`) code will load the kernelspace code (`example.ebpf.c`)

## Testing
To test, just run the generated binary:

    sudo ./example
